  <p>
    For college, I want to go to a school close by to home that is small.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passions have never changed, I always like business and fashion and want to major in something that relates these intrests.
    I might want to major in Computer Science, since technology is constantly changing the world, and my family is in technology. My dad woks for a tech company and my brother will major in Computer Science.
